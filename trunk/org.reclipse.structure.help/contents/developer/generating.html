<title>Story Diagram Generation</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Story Diagram Generation</h1>

	<p>The pattern analysis works on activities which have to be generated before a host graph (e.g. parsed source code) can be analyzed.</p>
	<p>We use a story diagram interpreter for the analysis, which will work on activities containing story patterns.</p>
	<p>Such activities will be generated in the following manner:</p>

	<h2>Preparation</h2>
	<p>Before we generate the classes, methods and its contained activities, we transform all <em>Set Nodes</em> into <em>Set Fragments</em> by wrapping them into a new, temporary set fragment.</p>

	<h2>Annotation Class Creation</h2>
	<p>For each specified pattern a new <code>PatternAnnotation</code> EClass will be generated which will be used for annotations of the pattern when the story diagram is interpreted.</p>
	
	<h2>Engine Class Creation</h2>
	<p>For each non-abstract pattern a new <code>PatternEngine</code> EClass will be generated. This class contains the activities that will be interpreted to annotate the specified pattern on a host graph.</p>
	<p>In the following all generated methods with its contained activity will be described.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<h3>Annotate</h3>
			<p>Signature: <code>annotate(EObject context, boolean searchAdditionals, PatternEngine this): AnnotationSet</code></p>
			<p>The contained activity is the entry point to annotate the pattern. The following figure represents a general overview over the annotation activity.</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>Match Core</dt>
				<dd>Matches all <em>core nodes</em>: all nodes will be matched that comply to the following constraints:
					<ul>
						<li>Node has <strong>no modifier</strong></li>
						<li>Node is <strong>not contained in any fragment</strong></li>
					</ul>
				</dd>

				<dt>Match Negative Fragments</dt>
				<dd>For each negative fragment in the pattern, a single story pattern node will be created that matches all nodes contained in the fragment. On failure the whole pattern cannot be applied to the current context and therefore a new core matching is necessary.</dd>
		
				<dt>Match Set Elements</dt>
				<dd>Before matching set fragments we try to match all mandatory nodes of all set fragments. When </dd>
			</dl>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Find Additional Elements</h3>
			<p>Signature: <code>findAdditionals(ASGAnnotation annotation, PatternEngine this): void</code></p>
			<p>This method and its contained activity will be generated when any additional element has been specified.</p>
		</li>
